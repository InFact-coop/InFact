# Meeting 23.05.2017

Present: Noga, Sohil, Emily, Elias, Bradley; on hangouts: Eoin, Jen (in a hospital gown); dropping in for item 1: Mark

## 1 - Anna Freud project

Mark has been here for a catchup meeting. We're still waiting for the go-ahead from his client, but turnaround should we quick if we get approval.

The client is hesitant because Mark and Alex are working independently of Anna Freud.

A start date within June is still possible.

Waiting for sign-off from senior management in the case of 2 other clients. These might be suitable for being scheduled after the NHS rethink project.


## 2 - Elias joining the coop

Elias is going to Gaza over the summer. He is happy to stand in for Eoin if Eoin not available. After returning from Gaza (September), he may be available to work part-time alongside working for DWYL.


## 3 - Getting more work in

Sohil says we need a strategy. Jessica and Yvonne from FAC10 are working on getting in projects for FAC10. This gives us some QA-ing and scrum-mastering opportunities.

We need to look out for events.


## 4 - NHS project

Workshop happening on June 29th. Noga, Brad and Dan have confirmed availability. The rest of us are expected to take part.

After that we'll choose a project to work on. Design starts beginning of August; development starts mid to end of August.

Project will be 4 dev sprints.

Eoin is available part time (e.g. 1 day a week for 2 weeks) but not on a daily basis. He will be available as of the second sprint in September.

Elias may be able to do remote QA but does not want to commit yet.

Jen will be in Nazareth by this time and is unsure of exact availability.

Emily doesn't want to work on her own.


## 4 - Coop and funding

Sion has asked if we want to apply for funding. We haven't responded yet.


## 5 - General things

Jen should be out of hospital on Thursday. Our IDEO meeting will be rearranged for then.

We need to get out and get work.
