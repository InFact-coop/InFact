## Minutes
### History & where we are now
See issue #17

### In-house vs. collaboration
Sion: When you say an "agency", you're talking about an Enterprise, made up of FAC graduates?
Do you work with creative designers? Are you looking to collaborate with other partners on projects? There are so many skills that come into running a project.

Noga/Sohil: Lucky to have a multi-skilled team who have interests in more areas than coding. Keep it in-house for now.

Sion: I can see how this group would evolve very quickly. You have an "in" into paid work. You have an interest in a particular sector. I think it's very interesting that you're rotating tasks. It's very unusual in Tech but actually very common in worker co-ops.

As we (Calverts) grew, we became more specialised. After a while it became evident that we needed someone to do the sales and marketing. There was silence in the meeting and I found myself saying "I'll do that". Little did I know, that would be what I would end up being my role.

When Calverts started, the average age was early-20s. Over time, the average age was in the 40s. Made an active drive to hire young people. There's a new spirit brought to the business from that.

If you've got a sympathetic client base, with open expectations, it seems like your offering would work.

### Potential difficulties
What are the potential difficulties for an emerging co-op? What are the red flags that we should think about because down the line they can become more and more complex?
+ Having a common vision. Keeping that strong. Making it explicit. Writing it down - having a manifesto/vision. That's your membership orientation document.
+ Pitfalls of being in a trading enterprise will arise naturally and you will learn that as you go
+ Business administration e.g. bookkeeping, maintaining register of members, running your governence stuff (making sure everything is recorded well). Do you have people who specialise in business admin or do you rotate those tasks? How do you service those "rather boring" aspects, that aren't core to what you're producing?
+ Political disagreements within the group. Because the enterprise was growing and we had work, everything looked like it was going well, we didn't address it. We became inefficient and it affected the quality of the work. We tried to solve it by bringing more people in.
+ Open book management. Making finances available to people in a way that they can understand. If you don't understand it, you can't be in control of it. When co-ops get into difficulties, it's when things aren't transparent. Maybe somebody whose role is dealing with financial information decides to sit on something and try and solve it, thinking "they don't need to know this". When you veer away from open, honest, solidarity-based organisation.
+ Where you get really unclear about membership. Clear expression about the process of becoming a member / falling out of membership. I see lots of co-ops saying "we all know really" but not making it explicit. Something goes wrong 6 months down the line, but nobody knows quite how to deal with it, because nobody knows how to deal with it or quite what happened.

### Employment and rates
Calverts has the same day rate if you're trained. Members are employed, not freelancers. £20ph NET. Charge-out rate £95ph.

The economy of hours is incredibly important. In this enterprise, which needs all of us, whatever role we are carrying out, we consider every role to be important in the proper functioning of the co-op. Our fees to clients are pretty much average for a firm of our size. Our overall wage bill is roughly average. But the way that we divide it is radical.

Depends on employed vs self-employed vs mixture.

To some degree, you learn these things as you go along. You develop the skills as you need them.

Co-ops are people organising around the question of work.

You can build flexibility into an employment model. A zero-hours contract model can be helpful, in order to retain flexibility but still be employed and gain all the benefits of being employed.

### Work first or structure first?
Noga: would you agree that we focus on getting some work done together and worry about structures once we know that we have that working?
Sion: It's a bit chicken and egg - whether you get governance & pay defined before work or start work first. But you don't want to embark on some work together without the same vision in mind.

Sion: People do need to know that there will be a large element of voluntary/unpaid work to start with. Keep a register of labour time (sweat equity).

Noga: So there's a tension here: you need to be fully committed, but you also need to fund yourself while you're not full time.  
How important would you say it is for people to throw themselves into it full time? What is the pattern that you've seen in co-ops that are successful - the ones that make it? Do people need to be throwing themselves all in?
Sion: If you can...yes. You need to be aware of each person's situation, and whether that's feasible. But ideally...it's about commitment.

### Membership
Sohil: Is 6 a good number? Is it too little?
Sion: An odd number is good, for voting purposes. But yeah, 6 is good. It's small enough to manage and be aware of everyone's situations. But it's a solid group of people. I have started coops before when there's just 2 of us.  
It's good to get all your members clear on what they bring. What is it that characterises _us_ as valuable members?
Noga: Agreed. That's a great place to start when you're thinking about new members.

Sion:
+ There will come a time when you have a range of experience and skills. You have to have some kind of policy for how you deal with that. To be a member, they have to come in with at least these skills. They have to understand the co-op. Someone we believe is trustworthy, open and honest. Someone who can bring something to the party of people. They won't be the same as you.  
+ There will always be something about the people who were the "founders". You have to think about that. Are we looking for people who are like us? They will never have been there for the initial formation. When you pour blood sweat and tears into it, is it fair that they don't have to go through that? These can be issues early-on. Start writing down policies.  
+ Write down what your characteristics are, and what makes you a good "co-operator". There is a cultural difference between working in something which is co-operative, and being committed to those principles, & something which isn't run that way.
+ Sometimes you will have situations where someone starts off as a "good" member & then turn into a "bad member". Have fair and transparent processes. It takes courage. You need to hold each other accountable. If people's behaviours fall significantly below what is needed, there has to be some kind of individual/collective courage to deal with it. There's no boss or HR to deal with it. It's yours.
+ You want a qualification between member of the co-op & employee. Technically you can, but culturally probably not. You don't want to entertain the idea of them joining the co-op, and getting the necessary training to become a member. If the other members accept that they've reached that point, then they can apply to become a member. After 40 years, Calverts are beefing up their membership process & training, because it's been too easy to become a member just by doing work.

### Governance
+ How do you moderate your discussions? Who is going to be the secetary? Do we have someone who is a natural concilliary, who takes on that role? Calverts doesn't have an HR person, but we have someone who is trusted, who essentially facilitates that conversation happening between individuals.
+ But if there is a diciplinary / performance issue that arises as a greivance against a member, that is formally registered & then we go into something which is analagous. Form an ad hoc group of 3 people that deal with this greivance. They have to be individuals who are not involved in the greivance. They are empowered to take that through to a warning or a dismissal. If the person wants to appeal, they appeal to the whole co-op. You want a process that's fair.

### Increasing in size
Sohil: Unlike a lot of co-ops who are slow in increasing members, to a certain extent, I see this as a way to take on a lot more people from downstairs. They worry is, can a co-op do that? Is it bad to grow to fast? We're talking about questions of criteria. None of that matters in the next year, because I don't think that will happen.
Noga: I think we all agree that to some extent, being able to offer this opportunity is part of our mission statement.
Sion: You will find the answers to that question by discussing it amongst yourselves. If you have explosive membership, how do you retain cooperative working? If you've got to train them to be members (whatever that training consists of), training and practicing are different.  
You could essentially create a new co-operative from every cohort, or every 2 cohorts? Maybe when you get to 20 people? You could have more of a hub and spokes kind of situation, rather than a simple collective? Might not be appropriate for you, because each cohort will be.  

This is the first venture you have done, work on working together and strengthening your relationships & how to handle the flow. It will take you a while to figure out how to do that, before you are ready for scaling. It's probably a problem that you'll be ready to deal with when it arises.

Any good co-op will be putting education front and centre. It's a human development movement.

### Relationship to FAC
Noga: What is our relationship to FAC?
Sion: It is autonomous and it chooses what relationships it enters into. You want to be housed here, be physically close & involved. That means FAC is your landlord. Do you pay rent, to retain your autonomy?
Sohil: There has to be some separation. There are always going to be people in FAC. We're doing something very different to other people in the space.
Dan: This is a conversation that could easily take us into the length of another meeting.
Jen: Let's bench this for the next meeting?

### Schemes
**The Hive** - [application form](https://www.uk.coop/the-hive/about/advice-and-training/application-advice-and-support/application-form)  
Sion: I could be doing some work with you more officially, and get paid by them.    
Could put an application in for 2 days of my time & we could sit down and work through some of that stuff (£400 per day)  
"We've been talking to Sion & if our application is successful, we would like to request working with him, etc etc.""  
One to one advice on becoming a cooperative

Legal & governance advice. 2 day package.
Draft the form out. Copy and paste it, send it to me so I can review it before you submit it.
I can book whatever time against that contract.
They will probably give 2 days, you could extend after that.

**Bright ideas** - Power to Change: community businesses. £15,000 grant attached.  
Outline who your community needs
Petra Morris at Coops UK is running both.
